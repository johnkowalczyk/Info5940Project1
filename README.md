## Setup Guide  

### 1Ô∏è: Clone the Repository  

Open a terminal and run:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnkowalczyk/Info5940Project1.git
cd INFO-5940
```

---
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Open in VS Code with Docker  

1. Open **VS Code**, navigate to the `INFO-5940` folder.  
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and search for:  
   ```
   Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container
   ```
3. Select this option. VS Code will build and open the project inside the container.  

üìå **Note:** If you don‚Äôt see this option, ensure that the **Remote - Containers** extension is installed.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure OpenAI API Key  
Set the API Key in `.env` (Recommended)  

1. Inside the project folder, create a `.env` file:  

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

2. Add your API key and base URL:  

   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.ai.it.cornell.edu/
   TZ=America/New_York
   ```

3. Restart the container:  

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

Now, after built, go to the localhost port 8501: 
```bash
http://0.0.0.0:8501/
```
